StriVe chip from efabless, Inc.

This is the StriVe chip, a test layout for the SkyWater sky130
process and an implementation of the picoRV32 microcontroller.

The contents of this repository were originally built around
the proprietary SkyWater S8 process before it was open sourced
and became SKY130.  This version of the repository has been
re-mapped from S8 to SKY130 and should be compatible with the
sky130 process, specifically the sky130A PDK installed by
open_pdks (https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks) using
the Google/SkyWater PDK (https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

The design for StriVe was migrated to the Caravel harness chip
(https://github.com/efabless/caravel), and so the contents of
this repository are more for historical interest and continuity
than for any practical manufacturing target.
